              <p>
                Outside of my qualifications on paper, I am driven by creating
                solutions to solve problems not only for myself but for others.
                Playing trading card games is one of my biggest hobbies. In
                2016, I created a spreadsheet based application performing
                linear operations, mathematically constructing optimal decks of
                playing cards. I shared the application with the public on a
                Reddit forum and the feedback was exceedingly positive, albeit
                with one shared concern; it is a spreadsheet.<br />
                <br />
                <br />Since then I have poured countless hours into planning and
                development to rectify the issue. Joining Team Treehouse in
                April of 2017 represented the largest advancement toward
                achieving a solution. Team Treehouse is an online technology
                school offering a wide range of courses spanning web
                development, databases, and modern programming languages such as
                C# and Go. I wake up around 3 am to study and or work on a
                limitless amount of projects offered by the program.<br />
                <br />
                <br />I have created multiple iterations of the application with
                JavaScript and the Bootstrap CSS framework. Earlier versions of
                the web-based app contained thousands of lines of code for
                creating, modifying, and removing DOM elements and performing
                calculations. The latest build is highly refined, as I have
                regulated DOM manipulation to Angular and data storage and
                retrieval to Node.js and MongoDB. The web-based application
                shall be available to the public by month’s end.<br />
                <br />
                <br />In the meantime, I am wrapping up a front-end tech
                certification through Team Treehouse’s “Techdegree” program this
                month. From there, I plan to continue my education with
                additional languages and technologies such as C# and Java-based
                REST APIs.
